    Official ISO
        The iso file that is released by Canonical, the official release of the
        Ubuntu operating system.

    Unattended ISO
        An ISO file that is the :term:`official iso` with an
        :term:`preseed file` and a special :term:`boot menu`. This ISO installs
        the Ubuntu operating system without user interaction, and shuts down
        the system afterwards.

    Preseed File
        This is a file that is used by the Ubuntu distribution to automate
        the installation of the Operating System.

    Boot Menu
        The menu that appears when the installer boots.

    Remaster
    Remastering
        This is the process of extracting the files of the :term:`official iso`
        to a temporary directory, adding some files, and creating the
        :term:`unattended iso`.
